// Audit trail for actions that are not a patient's: an Admin working a corporate

// `actor_id` so an admin id can never be mistaken for a patient id.
//
// Never pass a password, an OTP, a token or a full mobile number in `detail`. Writing the
// log must not break the action it describes, so a failure is reported and swallowed.
